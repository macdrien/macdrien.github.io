The goal is to generate a match tree for tournaments. I completed this project by adding a tournament creation form, defining the number of teams and players, and organizing matches randomly. The tournament display allows you to see the current match and present the winner(s). I also used these pages to test a display system with a choice of light and dark themes. I consider its first version finished, but I keep this project aside to add features, with data persistence at the top of the list."

This experience allowed me to significantly improve my English level up to the B2 required for the degree."
